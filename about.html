        <p>My name is Sydney Norris. I was born and raised in Columbus, GA and I am the youngest of two children. My hobbies include playing video games and binging TV shows. <br><br>
        I come from a family of teachers, so everyone expected me to follow the same career path, but I decided to create a path of my own. I originally graduated from the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!) with a BA in Sociology and wanted to become a Behavioral Technician. I realized that was not my passion and decided to change gears and pursue a career in technology.<br><br> I completed an AAS degree in Information Technology and got my first job as a Technical Analyst for a non-profit company. After working there for about a year and half I decided to move the Atlanta area and got a job as an Application Support Engineer for a software company. In this position I worked heavily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I began to lean toward wanting to become a web developer. I then found another opportunity, my current job, working for a major grocery store as a Senior Application Systems Analyst. In this position I manage the privacy management system for the company's websites. I also work heavily with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br>
        During my time at my current job I began pursuing a BAS in Information Technology with hopes of becoming a web developer after graduation. I feel this particular class is growing my knowledge and strenthening my web development skills. I am willing to put in the work to achieve my end-goal which is becoming a full-stack developer. There is still a lot for me to learn and I am excited to keep moving forward.</p>
